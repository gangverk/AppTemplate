# AppTemplate
Gangverk universal iOS app template.


## What is this?
This is Gangverk's app template to create a new (universal) iOS app. It uses our preferred folder structure, default pods and handy macros.

If you need a slide over menu, have a look at [gangverk/MenuSkeleton](https://github.com/gangverk/MenuSkeleton) for a good skeleton that fits this project template.


## Create a new project from the template
```
git clone git@github.com:gangverk/AppTemplate.git
cd AppTemplate
./clone.py
```

Run `pod install` in your newly created project folder and from then on only open the workspace.

You should also edit the Makefile in your new project and enter the correct Hockey API key.
